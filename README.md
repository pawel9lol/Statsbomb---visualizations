This project utilizes free data from the 2023/24 Bundesliga season for Bayer Leverkusen 04, sourced from StatsBomb, to create visualizations of shot maps. The code is written in Python and generates two types of visualizations: one for an individual player and another displaying the shot maps for the five players with the most shots for a team. 

The data used in this project is obtained from the StatsBomb open data repository. It includes detailed event data for matches involving Bayer Leverkusen during the 2023/24 Bundesliga season.
